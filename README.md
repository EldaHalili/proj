The cronology that i have followed:

I installed Python3.12.3 
I installed MYSQL and created the database notes there. 
I have used flask as an API for python. 

The backend is done using python and flask for python, and frontend using html,js, and css. 

I have defined  routes for your API endpoints using Flask's @app.route. 

I have implemented function create and delete . Notes can be deleted from the user whenever with the delete button that follows each note that is created.

Also there is the file test_scripts.py for unitests.

In the file i have added images of MySql database, for the notes that have been stored there during the time that i was creating the application.
